# discord-no-mosaic
Attempts to remove the newer "Media Mosaic" media layout on Discord, replacing it with the old method of listing attachments vertically used until 2023.
Might be a little wonky on some image layouts, haven't tested them all. If you have any problems, please make an issue! If anyone would like to submit a PR to fix anything, feel free, as I, like the original creator, do not know JS that well.
